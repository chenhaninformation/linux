This branch is for espressobin board and it is based on mainline Linux,
tag v4.19, please refer to: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/v4.19

You can find documentation at the mainline Linux, we only provide some of
the build steps and some note.

Note
====

1.We add a brand new defconfig file at arch/arm64/configs/, it is a copy of
defconfig named espressobin_defconfig by disable some other platform configs,
enable OverlayFS build-in by default and enable RAID support by default.

2.The linux kernel shold compile with ramfs cpio archive, which will mount an
OverlayFS as root and switch to this OverlayFS from ramfs. More information
please refer to https://github.com/chenhaninfomation/buildroot.

Build Step
==========

Normal compile step are shown in follow:
1.export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/aarch64/compiler
2.export ARCH=arm64
3.make defconfig
4.make

Due to new defconfig has been added, please use espressobin_defconfig instead
of the old one:
1.export CROSS_COMPILE=/path/to/aarch64/compiler
2.export ARCH=arm64
3.make espressobin_defconfig # Use espressobin_defconfig
4.make
